# ðŸ“š Kush Reads  

Kush Reads is my personal library website where I showcase my taste in books. What I am currently reading, have read, some of my favourites with ratings and ofcourse, what I want to read in the future or the books that I have in my physical TBR.

You can even read some public domain books as an EBook by clicking on the books with this -> ðŸ“Ž  emoji on the top right. Public domain books are creative works whose copyrights have expired or were never granted, making them free for anyone to use, copy, distribute, and adapt without permission.

### Why did I create this website?

I wanted to just track my reading journey. One day I got an idea when I was reading a book, Why not create a website to keep track of what I am reading, what I've read in the past (other than boring academic books ofcourse), and what are some of my favourites. I got another idea for the you (the stalkers à¶ž) to attach project gutenberg link, so that you can read the public domain books online for free. There are tons of classic books out there that are in public domain so they can be read for free online.
